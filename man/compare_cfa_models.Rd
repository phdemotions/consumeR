\title{Compare Nested CFA Models}
\usage{
compare_cfa_models(fit_small, fit_large, test = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_small}{lavaan fit object for the more constrained (smaller) model}

\item{fit_large}{lavaan fit object for the less constrained (larger) model}

\item{test}{Character. Test to use: "default" (chi-square difference),
"satorra.bentler", "yuan.bentler.mplus"}
}
\value{
A tibble comparing the two models with:
\itemize{
  \item Fit indices for each model
  \item Chi-square difference test results
  \item AIC/BIC comparison
}
}
\description{
Compares two nested CFA models using chi-square difference test.
Also reports AIC and BIC for model comparison.
}
\details{
**Nested models:**
- Model A is nested in Model B if A is a restricted version of B
- Example: 1-factor model is nested in 2-factor model

**Chi-square difference test:**
- Tests if the larger model fits significantly better
- Δχ² = χ²_small - χ²_large
- Δdf = df_small - df_large
- If p < .05: Larger model fits significantly better

**AIC/BIC:**
- Lower is better
- Difference > 10 indicates strong preference
