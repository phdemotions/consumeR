\description{
Analyze parallel mediation models where multiple mediators operate
simultaneously between X and Y. Uses bootstrap confidence intervals for
specific indirect effects following Preacher & Hayes (2008).
}
\details{
**Parallel Mediation Model**:

X → M1 → Y
X → M2 → Y
X → M3 → Y
X ⇢ Y (direct effect)

Each mediator operates independently. Total indirect effect is the sum of
specific indirect effects: (a1*b1) + (a2*b2) + (a3*b3) + ...

**Specific Indirect Effects**:
\itemize{
  \item Indirect effect through M1: a1 * b1
  \item Indirect effect through M2: a2 * b2
  \item Each tested with bootstrap CI
}

**Contrasts**:
Tests whether specific indirect effects differ from each other. Significant
contrast indicates one mediator is stronger than another.

**JCP Reporting Requirements**:
\itemize{
  \item Report all specific indirect effects with bootstrap CIs
  \item Report total indirect effect
  \item Report direct effect (c')
  \item Conduct contrasts if comparing mediators
  \item Use ≥5000 bootstrap samples for publication
  \item Report which mediators are significant
