\title{Consumer Survey Example Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 100 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
  \item{customer_id}{Unique customer identifier (1-100)}
  \item{customer_name}{Customer name (character). Fictional names used for
    pedagogical purposes and dataset memorability.}
  \item{flyer_group}{Experimental condition: "Got Flyer" (treatment) or
    "No Flyer" (control). The independent variable for analysis.}
  \item{spending}{Customer spending in dollars (numeric, continuous).
    Primary outcome variable for hypothesis testing.}
  \item{satisfaction}{Satisfaction rating on 1-10 scale (integer, ordinal).
    Secondary outcome measuring customer experience.}
  \item{loyalty_score}{Loyalty score on 0-100 scale (numeric, continuous).
    Represents likelihood of repeat business and referrals.}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data generated for pedagogical purposes. The data structure and
effect sizes are based on typical consumer research studies in retail settings.
Customer names are fictional and selected to make the dataset memorable for
teaching contexts.
}
\usage{
consumer_survey
}
\description{
This dataset simulates a marketing experiment testing whether promotional
flyers increase customer spending. Fifty customers received promotional
materials ("Got Flyer" group) and fifty served as controls ("No Flyer" group).
The data structure and effect sizes are representative of typical consumer
research studies.

The dataset is available as `consumer_survey` when the package is loaded.
All customer names are fictional and do not represent real individuals.
}
\details{
A simulated dataset representing a randomized controlled trial in retail
consumer research. Designed for teaching and demonstrating statistical
analysis workflows.


## Research Question

Does receiving promotional flyers increase customer spending compared to
a control condition? This represents a common marketing research design
evaluating intervention effectiveness.

## Study Design

- **Design**: Randomized controlled trial (between-subjects)
- **Sample size**: N = 100 (50 per condition)
- **Treatment**: Promotional flyer with special offers
- **Control**: Standard shopping experience
- **Outcomes**: Spending (dollars), satisfaction (1-10), loyalty (0-100)
- **Missing data**: Three observations have missing values on different
  variables to demonstrate missing data handling

## Expected Results

The treatment effect represents a small-to-medium effect size (Cohen's d ≈ 0.5),
typical of marketing interventions. This allows for demonstrating both
significant effects and the importance of effect size interpretation.

## Usage Examples

**Basic exploration**:
```r
data(consumer_survey)
head(consumer_survey)
summary(consumer_survey)
```

**Hypothesis testing**:
```r
# Compare spending between groups
library(dplyr)
treatment <- consumer_survey %>%
  filter(flyer_group == "Got Flyer") %>%
  pull(spending)
control <- consumer_survey %>%
  filter(flyer_group == "No Flyer") %>%
  pull(spending)

result <- test_group_differences(treatment, control)
print(result)
```

**Descriptive statistics by group**:
```r
consumer_survey %>%
  group_by(flyer_group) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_spending = mean(spending, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_spending = sd(spending, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
}
