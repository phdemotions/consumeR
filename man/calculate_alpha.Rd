\title{Calculate Cronbach's Alpha for Scale Reliability}
\usage{
calculate_alpha(
  data,
  items,
  scale_name = "Scale",
  reverse_items = NULL,
  item_labels = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing your survey items}

\item{items}{Character vector of column names for the items in your scale.
For example: c("satisfaction_1", "satisfaction_2", "satisfaction_3")}

\item{scale_name}{Character string. A descriptive name for your scale
(e.g., "Customer Satisfaction"). This makes output easier to read.}

\item{reverse_items}{Optional character vector of items to reverse-score.
Use this when some items are worded negatively. Default is NULL.}

\item{item_labels}{Optional named character vector mapping item names to
plain English labels. For example: c(satisfaction_1 = "Overall satisfaction",
satisfaction_2 = "Would recommend"). Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{alpha}: Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0 to 1)
    \item \code{interpretation}: Plain English interpretation
    \item \code{n_items}: Number of items in the scale
    \item \code{n_observations}: Number of complete responses
    \item \code{item_statistics}: Data frame with statistics for each item
    \item \code{alpha_if_deleted}: What alpha would be if each item removed
    \item \code{inter_item_correlations}: Average correlation between items
    \item \code{scale_mean}: Mean of the composite scale
    \item \code{scale_sd}: Standard deviation of the composite scale
  }
}
\description{
This function calculates Cronbach's alpha and other reliability measures
for multi-item scales in a completely transparent way. Every step is
documented so reviewers can understand exactly how reliability was assessed.
}
\details{
Think of this like checking if survey questions measure the same thing
consistently - like asking "How satisfied are you?" in three different ways
and making sure people answer similarly to all three.


## What is Cronbach's Alpha?
Cronbach's alpha measures internal consistency - whether items that are
supposed to measure the same thing actually correlate with each other.

## Interpreting Alpha:
- **α ≥ 0.90**: Excellent reliability
- **α ≥ 0.80**: Good reliability
- **α ≥ 0.70**: Acceptable reliability
- **α ≥ 0.60**: Questionable reliability
- **α < 0.60**: Poor reliability

## How It's Calculated:
Alpha = (k / (k-1)) * (1 - sum of item variances / total variance)
where k = number of items

## Transparency for Reviewers:
This function shows:
1. Which items were included
2. How many responses were used
3. Statistics for each individual item
4. What happens if you remove each item
5. The final alpha value with interpretation

\examples{
# Example 1: Customer satisfaction scale
# Imagine we asked Cloud 9 customers three satisfaction questions
satisfaction_data <- data.frame(
  customer_id = 1:20,
  sat_overall = c(7,8,6,9,7,8,9,7,6,8,7,9,8,7,8,9,7,8,7,8),
  sat_recommend = c(8,9,7,9,8,9,9,8,7,9,8,9,9,8,9,9,8,9,8,9),
  sat_return = c(7,8,6,8,7,8,8,7,6,8,7,8,8,7,8,8,7,8,7,8)
)

# Calculate reliability
reliability <- calculate_alpha(
  data = satisfaction_data,
  items = c("sat_overall", "sat_recommend", "sat_return"),
  scale_name = "Customer Satisfaction"
)

# View results
cat(reliability$interpretation)
print(reliability$alpha)

# Example 2: With item labels for clarity
reliability <- calculate_alpha(
  data = satisfaction_data,
  items = c("sat_overall", "sat_recommend", "sat_return"),
  scale_name = "Customer Satisfaction",
  item_labels = c(
    sat_overall = "Overall satisfaction with Cloud 9",
    sat_recommend = "Would recommend to friends",
    sat_return = "Likelihood to return"
  )
)

# Example 3: With reverse-coded items
# Some items might be worded negatively (e.g., "I was dissatisfied")
mixed_data <- data.frame(
  happy_1 = c(7,8,9,7,8),      # Positive wording
  unhappy_2 = c(3,2,1,3,2),    # Negative wording (needs reversing)
  happy_3 = c(8,9,9,8,9)       # Positive wording
)

reliability <- calculate_alpha(
  data = mixed_data,
  items = c("happy_1", "unhappy_2", "happy_3"),
  scale_name = "Happiness",
  reverse_items = c("unhappy_2")  # Reverse the negative item
)

}
