\title{Check Normality Assumption (Gold Standard)}
\usage{
check_normality(data, variable_name = "data", alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector to test for normality}

\item{variable_name}{Character string naming the variable (for reporting).
Default is "data". Used in all output messages.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for the test (default 0.05).
Must be between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class "assumption_check" containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{test}: Name of the test ("Shapiro-Wilk")
    \item \code{assumption}: Which assumption was tested ("Normality")
    \item \code{assumption_met}: Logical. TRUE if assumption is met (p > alpha)
    \item \code{p_value}: P-value from Shapiro-Wilk test (APA 7 formatted)
    \item \code{statistic}: W statistic (ranges 0-1, higher = more normal)

    \item \code{n_missing}: Number of NA values removed
    \item \code{alpha}: Significance level used
    \item \code{skewness}: Measure of asymmetry (0 = symmetric)
    \item \code{kurtosis}: Measure of tail heaviness (0 = normal tails)

\description{
Tests whether data follows a normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Provides comprehensive interpretation for beginners, including visual diagnostics,
educational explanations, and APA 7 formatted results.

This function is designed to be self-explanatory for users new to statistics,
with extensive validation and beginner-friendly error messages.

\details{
**What is the normality assumption?**

Many statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression) assume that data
follows a "normal distribution" (bell-shaped curve). This function tests
whether your data meets this assumption.

**How to interpret results:**
- If p > 0.05: Normality assumption is MET (good news!)
- If p < 0.05: Normality assumption is VIOLATED (need alternatives)

**What to do if violated:**
1. Use non-parametric tests (don't assume normality)
2. Transform data (log, square root, Box-Cox)
3. If n > 30, parametric tests often still work (Central Limit Theorem)

\examples{
# Example 1: Normal data
normal_data <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
check_normality(normal_data, "satisfaction_scores")

# Example 2: Skewed data (not normal)
skewed_data <- rexp(100, rate = 0.5)
check_normality(skewed_data, "income")

# Example 3: With missing values
data_with_na <- c(rnorm(95), NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
check_normality(data_with_na, "responses")
