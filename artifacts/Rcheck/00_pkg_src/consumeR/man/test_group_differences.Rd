\usage{
test_group_differences(
  group1,
  group2,
  test_type = "auto",
  alternative = "two.sided",
  conf_level = 0.95,
  paired = FALSE,
  check_assumptions = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A numeric vector containing data for the first group.
For example, spending amounts for treatment group consumers.}

\item{group2}{A numeric vector containing data for the second group.
For example, spending amounts for control group consumers.}

\item{test_type}{Character string specifying which test to use.
Options are:
\itemize{
  \item "t.test" - Student's t-test (assumes normal distribution)
  \item "wilcoxon" - Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-parametric)
  \item "auto" - Automatically chooses based on sample size (default)
}}

\item{alternative}{Character string specifying the alternative hypothesis.
Options are "two.sided" (default), "greater", or "less".}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric. Confidence level for the interval. Default is 0.95
(95% confidence).}

\item{paired}{Logical. Are the observations paired? Default is FALSE.}

\item{check_assumptions}{Logical. Should assumptions be tested? Default is TRUE.
When TRUE, tests for normality and homogeneity of variance are performed
and results are included in output.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Should detailed explanations be provided? Default is TRUE.
When TRUE, includes verbose explanations suitable for learning.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{test_used}: Name of the statistical test performed
    \item \code{p_value}: P-value from the test
    \item \code{significant}: Logical, TRUE if p < 0.05
    \item \code{group1_mean}: Mean of group 1
    \item \code{group2_mean}: Mean of group 2
    \item \code{group1_sd}: Standard deviation of group 1
    \item \code{group2_sd}: Standard deviation of group 2
    \item \code{difference}: Difference between group means
    \item \code{effect_size}: Cohen's d effect size
    \item \code{interpretation}: Plain English interpretation of results
    \item \code{assumptions}: List of assumption check results (if check_assumptions = TRUE)
    \item \code{publication_text}: Publication-ready text block
    \item \code{full_test_output}: Complete test results object
  }
}
\description{
This function compares two groups of consumers to determine if they
are statistically different. It is designed for maximum transparency
during peer review, with clear documentation of every step and assumption.
}
\details{
The function performs either a t-test (for normally distributed data)
or a Wilcoxon test (for non-normal data). All steps are documented
and assumptions are clearly stated.

## How the Test Selection Works:
When test_type = "auto" (default), the function chooses:
\itemize{
  \item t-test if both groups have n >= 30 (Central Limit Theorem applies)
  \item Wilcoxon test if either group has n < 30 (safer for small samples)
}

## Interpreting Results:
\itemize{
  \item p_value < 0.05: Groups are significantly different (reject null hypothesis)
  \item p_value >= 0.05: No significant difference detected (fail to reject null)
}
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Compare spending between two groups
treatment_spending <- c(45.2, 67.8, 23.4, 89.1, 34.5, 56.7, 78.9, 12.3)
control_spending <- c(34.1, 45.2, 28.9, 56.3, 41.2, 38.7, 49.1, 31.4)
test_group_differences(treatment_spending, control_spending)

# Example 2: One-sided test (is group 1 greater than group 2?)
satisfaction_a <- c(7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7)
satisfaction_b <- c(5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 6, 5, 7)
test_group_differences(satisfaction_a, satisfaction_b, alternative = "greater")

# Example 3: Paired observations (before/after measurements)
before <- c(65, 72, 68, 71, 69, 70)
after <- c(62, 68, 65, 69, 66, 67)
test_group_differences(before, after, paired = TRUE)
