\title{Identify Problematic Response Values in SPSS Data}
\usage{
identify_problematic_values(
  label_df,
  patterns = c("don'?t know", "dk\\\\b", "unsure", "refuse", "declined?", "prefer not",
    "not applicable", "n/?a\\\\b", "missing", "no response", "skipped", "^99+$", "^-9+$",
    "^-1$")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{label_df}{Data frame from extract_value_labels() with columns value, label}

\item{patterns}{Character vector of regex patterns to match problematic labels.
Default includes common problematic response patterns.}
}
\value{
Data frame subset of label_df containing only problematic values,
  or NULL if none found. Adds a "reason" column explaining why it was flagged.
}
\description{
**L1 Internal Helper.** Scans value labels to identify codes that represent
non-substantive responses (e.g., "Don't know", "Refused", "Not applicable").
These often need to be recoded to NA before analysis.
}
\details{
**What this identifies:**
Response codes that don't represent actual data, such as:
- "Don't know" / "DK" / "Unsure"
- "Refused" / "Decline to answer" / "Prefer not to say"
- "Not applicable" / "NA" / "N/A"
- "Missing" / "No response"
- Numeric codes like 99, 999, -99, -1 (common SPSS missing codes)

**Why this matters:**
These should usually be recoded to NA before computing means, correlations,
or other statistics. Otherwise, "99 = Don't know" will be treated as a
very high response, inflating your results.

# Get labels for a variable

# Find problematic values
problems <- identify_problematic_values(labels)
#   value label              reason
#   99    Don't know         Don't know response
#   -1    Not applicable     Not applicable response
