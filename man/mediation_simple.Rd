A list of class "mediation_simple" containing:
  - paths: Tibble with path coefficients (a, b, c, c_prime) and SEs
  - indirect_effect: Tibble with indirect effect (a*b), SE, and bootstrap CI
  - total_effect: Total effect (c path)
  - direct_effect: Direct effect (c' path)
  - proportion_mediated: Proportion of total effect mediated (PM = ab/c)

  - boot_distribution: Full bootstrap distribution of indirect effect
  - interpretation: Publication-ready interpretation text
}
\description{
Performs simple mediation analysis for the causal path X → M → Y using
bootstrap resampling to estimate confidence intervals for indirect effects.
This is the gold standard approach for mediation in consumer psychology
research, recommended by Preacher & Hayes (2004, 2008).
}
\details{
**Mediation Model:**
- Path a: X → M (effect of X on mediator)
- Path b: M → Y (effect of mediator on Y, controlling for X)
- Path c: X → Y (total effect, without mediator)
- Path c': X → Y (direct effect, controlling for mediator)
- Indirect effect: a*b (mediated effect through M)

**Significance Testing:**
The indirect effect is significant if the bootstrap confidence interval
does not include zero. This is more powerful than the Sobel test and does
not assume normality of the sampling distribution.

**Types of Mediation:**
- Full mediation: Indirect effect significant, direct effect (c') not significant
- Partial mediation: Both indirect and direct effects significant
- No mediation: Indirect effect not significant

**For JCP Publications:**
- Use ≥ 5000 bootstrap samples (10000 for critical tests)
- Report bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) CIs
- Report all path coefficients with SEs
- Report proportion mediated if total effect is significant
- Visualize mediation model with path diagram
