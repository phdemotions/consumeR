\usage{
johnson_neyman(
  model,
  focal,
  moderator,
  alpha = 0.05,
  mod_range = NULL,
  n_points = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted linear model (lm object) with an interaction term}

\item{focal}{Character; name of the focal predictor (X variable)}

\item{moderator}{Character; name of the moderator variable (W variable)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default: 0.05)}

\item{mod_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying range of moderator
values to search. Default: NULL (uses observed range +/- 1 SD)}

\item{n_points}{Number of points to evaluate (default: 1000)}
}
\value{
A list of class "johnson_neyman" containing:
  - critical_values: Tibble with moderator values where effect transitions
    between significant and non-significant
  - regions: Tibble describing regions of significance
  - slopes_at_points: Tibble with slopes and CIs across moderator range
  - focal: Name of focal predictor
  - moderator: Name of moderator
  - interpretation: Publication-ready interpretation text
}
\description{
Identifies the range of moderator values where the effect of a focal predictor
is statistically significant. This provides more nuanced interpretation than
simple slopes at arbitrary values (e.g., +/- 1 SD), showing exactly where the
effect "turns on" and "turns off" as a function of the moderator.
}
\details{
The Johnson-Neyman technique solves for the value(s) of W where the confidence
interval for the simple slope of X equals zero. This identifies "transition
points" between significant and non-significant effects.

**Output Regions:**
- Region 1: W < lower bound -> effect significant/non-significant
- Region 2: lower < W < upper -> effect non-significant/significant
- Region 3: W > upper bound -> effect significant/non-significant

**For JCP Publications:**
- Use JN technique for continuous moderators
- Report transition point(s) with precision
- Visualize with region of significance plot
- Describe substantive meaning (e.g., "The price effect is significant for
  customers with loyalty scores above 4.2")

\examples{
# Price sensitivity moderated by brand loyalty
set.seed(42)
n <- 200
df <- data.frame(
  price = rnorm(n, 50, 10),
  loyalty = rnorm(n, 5, 1.5),
  purchase = rnorm(n, 5, 1)
)
df$purchase <- df$purchase - 0.1 * df$price + 0.3 * df$loyalty +
               0.05 * df$price * df$loyalty

model <- lm(purchase ~ price * loyalty, data = df)

# Find regions of significance
jn <- johnson_neyman(model, focal = "price", moderator = "loyalty")
print(jn)
