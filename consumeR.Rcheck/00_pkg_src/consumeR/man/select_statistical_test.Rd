  interactive = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Optional data frame to analyze}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome/dependent variable (optional)}

\item{predictor}{Character. Name of the predictor/independent variable (optional)}

\item{interactive}{Logical. Run in interactive mode with prompts? Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{recommended_test}{Name of recommended statistical test}
    \item{function_name}{consumeR function to use}
    \item{explanation}{Why this test is appropriate}
    \item{assumptions}{What to check before running the test}
    \item{example_code}{Example code to run the test}
    \item{alternative_tests}{Other tests to consider}

# Interactive mode - answers questions step by step

# Or provide variables upfront for quick recommendation
