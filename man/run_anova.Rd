\title{Run ANOVA with Type II or Type III Sums of Squares}
\usage{
run_anova(
  model,
  type = c("II", "III", "2", "3"),
  test_statistic = "F",
  white_adjust = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Fitted lm or aov model}

\item{type}{Character. Type of sums of squares: "II" (default) or "III"}

\item{test_statistic}{Character. Test statistic: "F" (default), "Chisq", "LR"}

\item{white_adjust}{Logical. Use White's heteroscedasticity correction? (default FALSE)}
}
\value{
A tibble containing ANOVA results with:
\itemize{
  \item Term names
  \item Sums of squares
  \item Degrees of freedom
  \item F statistics
  \item P-values
  \item Partial eta-squared (effect size)
  \item Interpretation (small/medium/large effect)
}
}
\description{
Wrapper around car::Anova() for Type II or Type III sums of squares.
Includes effect size (partial eta-squared) and publication-ready output.
}
\details{
**Type II vs Type III:**
- **Type II**: Tests main effects after other main effects (not interactions)
  - Use when: No significant interactions, balanced or unbalanced designs
  - Most appropriate for observational studies
- **Type III**: Tests each effect after all other effects
  - Use when: Significant interactions present, want to test simple effects
  - Required for unbalanced designs with interactions

**Partial Eta-Squared (η²p):**
- Effect size: proportion of variance explained by each term
- Guidelines: 0.01 = small, 0.06 = medium, 0.14 = large
- More appropriate than eta-squared for factorial designs

**JCP Requirements:**
- Always report effect sizes, not just p-values
- Report Type II vs III decision
- Report assumption checks (see assumption_checks())
