\title{Run Logistic Regression for Binary Outcomes}
\usage{
run_logistic(formula, data, family = stats::binomial(link = "logit"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the model (e.g., \code{outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2})}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables}

\item{family}{The family to use (default: binomial(link = "logit"))}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{glm()}}
}
\value{
A glm object of class "logistic_model" with additional attributes:
  - n_obs: Number of observations
  - n_events: Number of events (outcome = 1)
  - event_rate: Proportion of events
  - predictors: Names of predictor variables
}
\description{
Fits a logistic regression model for binary outcomes, commonly used in consumer
psychology research to model purchase decisions, choice behavior, adoption,
and other binary outcomes. Returns a standard glm object that can be further
analyzed with \code{tidy_logistic()} for publication-ready results.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper around \code{glm()} with sensible defaults for
consumer psychology research. The outcome variable must be binary (0/1, FALSE/TRUE,
or a two-level factor). Use \code{tidy_logistic()} to extract odds ratios and
confidence intervals, and \code{logistic_assumptions()} to check model assumptions.

For JCP publications, always report:
- Odds ratios with 95% CIs
- Model fit statistics (AIC, pseudo-R^2)
- Assumption checks (linearity of logit, multicollinearity)
- Classification accuracy if relevant

\examples{
# Purchase decision based on price and quality perceptions
set.seed(42)
n <- 200
df <- data.frame(
  purchased = sample(0:1, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)),
  price = rnorm(n, 50, 10),
  quality = rnorm(n, 5, 1),
  age = sample(18:65, n, replace = TRUE)
)

# Fit logistic regression
model <- run_logistic(purchased ~ price + quality + age, data = df)
summary(model)

# Get publication-ready results with odds ratios
results <- tidy_logistic(model)
print(results)
