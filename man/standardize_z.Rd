\usage{
standardize_z(x, na.rm = TRUE, check_variance = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector to standardize}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Default TRUE.}

\item{check_variance}{Logical. Should function check for zero variance? Default TRUE.}

\value{
List containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{standardized}: Numeric vector of z-scores
    \item \code{meta}: List with:
      \itemize{
        \item \code{method}: "z-score"
        \item \code{original_mean}: Mean before standardization
        \item \code{original_sd}: SD before standardization
        \item \code{n_valid}: Number of non-missing values
        \item \code{n_missing}: Number of missing values
      }

\description{
**L1 Internal Helper.** Standardizes a numeric vector to have mean = 0 and SD = 1.
This is the most common and statistically defensible standardization method.
}
\details{
**Formula:** \code{z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)}

**What this produces:**
- Mean of standardized variable = 0
- SD of standardized variable = 1
- Preserves shape of distribution
- Interpretation: "how many standard deviations above/below the mean"

**When to use:**
- Combining variables measured on different scales
- Creating composites where items have different variances
- Standard practice in psychology and consumer research

**Peer review justification:**
Z-score standardization is the default in most statistical software and
is universally accepted in peer review. It preserves the relative distances
between observations while putting variables on a common scale.

**Warnings:**
- If SD = 0 (no variance), standardization is impossible. Function will
  error with an educational message suggesting alternatives.
- With very small n (< 10), standardization may be unstable.

# Basic usage
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
result <- standardize_z(x)
result$standardized
# Mean ≈ 0, SD ≈ 1

# With missing values
x_na <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, 6, 7)
result <- standardize_z(x_na, na.rm = TRUE)

# Check metadata
result$meta$original_mean  # 3.71 (mean of non-missing)
result$meta$original_sd    # 2.14
