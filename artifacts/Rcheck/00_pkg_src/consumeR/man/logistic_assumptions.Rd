\usage{
logistic_assumptions(
  model,
  data,
  vif_threshold = 5,
  cooks_threshold = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A logistic regression model from \code{run_logistic()} or \code{glm()}}

\item{data}{The original data frame used to fit the model}

\item{vif_threshold}{Variance Inflation Factor threshold for multicollinearity
(default: 5; values > threshold indicate problematic collinearity)}

\item{cooks_threshold}{Cook's distance threshold for influential cases
(default: 4/n where n is sample size)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for tests (default: 0.05)}
}
\value{
A list of class "logistic_assumptions" containing:
  - linearity: Box-Tidwell test results for linearity of logit
  - vif: Variance Inflation Factors for multicollinearity
  - influential: Number and IDs of influential cases (Cook's D)
  - separation: Check for perfect/quasi-complete separation
  - hosmer_lemeshow: Goodness-of-fit test (if available)
  - remediation: Text recommendations for addressing violations
  - all_pass: Logical indicating if all assumptions met
}
\description{
Performs comprehensive diagnostic checks for logistic regression models,
including linearity of the logit, influential cases, multicollinearity,
and separation issues. Returns remediation recommendations for violations.
}
\details{
Key assumptions for logistic regression:

1. **Linearity of the logit**: Continuous predictors should have a linear
   relationship with log-odds. Tested using Box-Tidwell transformation.

2. **No multicollinearity**: VIF < 5 (conservative) or < 10 (liberal).
   High VIF inflates standard errors and reduces power.

3. **No influential outliers**: Cook's D > 4/n suggests influential case.
   Remove or investigate cases with high influence.

4. **No separation**: Perfect separation occurs when outcome can be perfectly
   predicted by predictors. Causes infinite coefficient estimates.

For JCP publications, report assumption checks and remedial actions taken.
