\usage{
simple_slopes(
  model,
  focal,
  moderator,
  mod_values = NULL,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  center_moderator = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted linear model (lm object) with an interaction term}

\item{focal}{Character; name of the focal predictor (X variable)}

\item{moderator}{Character; name of the moderator variable (W variable)}

\item{mod_values}{Numeric vector of moderator values to probe. Default: NULL
(uses mean +/- 1 SD for continuous moderators, or all levels for factors)}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level for intervals (default: 0.95)}

\item{center_moderator}{Logical; center moderator before probing (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list of class "simple_slopes" containing:
  - slopes: Tibble with simple slopes at each moderator value
  - mod_values: Values of moderator used
  - focal: Name of focal predictor
  - moderator: Name of moderator
  - interpretation: Publication-ready interpretation text
}
\description{
Probes two-way interactions by testing the effect of a focal predictor at
different values of a moderator variable. This is essential for interpreting
significant interactions in consumer psychology research, as recommended by
Aiken & West (1991) and Hayes (2018).
}
\details{
Simple slopes analysis examines the effect of X on Y at specific values of W.
For continuous moderators, the default values are:
- Low: Mean - 1 SD
- Medium: Mean
- High: Mean + 1 SD

For categorical moderators, slopes are computed at each level.

**Interpretation:**
- If slopes differ significantly across moderator values, the interaction is
  meaningful
- Report the slope and significance test at each moderator value
- Consider Johnson-Neyman technique for continuous moderators to find regions
  of significance

**For JCP Publications:**
- Always probe significant interactions
- Report simple slopes with standard errors and CIs
- Include visualization (interaction plot)
- Consider Johnson-Neyman if continuous moderator

\examples{
# Price sensitivity moderated by brand loyalty
set.seed(42)
n <- 150
df <- data.frame(
  price = rnorm(n, 50, 10),
  loyalty = rnorm(n, 5, 1.5),
  purchase = rnorm(n, 5, 1)
)
# Interaction: price effect depends on loyalty
df$purchase <- df$purchase - 0.1 * df$price + 0.3 * df$loyalty +
               0.05 * df$price * df$loyalty

# Fit model with interaction
model <- lm(purchase ~ price * loyalty, data = df)

# Probe interaction with simple slopes
slopes <- simple_slopes(model, focal = "price", moderator = "loyalty")
print(slopes)
