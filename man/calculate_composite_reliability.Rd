\title{Calculate Composite Reliability and Validity Measures}
\usage{
calculate_composite_reliability(
  data,
  items,
  scale_name = "Scale",
  item_labels = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing your survey items}

\item{items}{Character vector of column names for the items in your scale}

\item{scale_name}{Character string. Descriptive name for your scale}

\item{item_labels}{Optional named character vector for plain English labels}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{cronbachs_alpha}: Traditional Cronbach's alpha
    \item \code{composite_reliability}: Composite reliability (CR)
    \item \code{ave}: Average variance extracted
    \item \code{sqrt_ave}: Square root of AVE (for discriminant validity)
    \item \code{interpretation}: Plain English summary
    \item \code{factor_loadings}: Standardized loadings for each item
    \item \code{passes_threshold}: Whether scale meets quality thresholds
  }
}
\description{
This function calculates multiple reliability and validity measures for
multi-item scales, going beyond Cronbach's alpha. It includes Composite
Reliability (CR) and Average Variance Extracted (AVE), which are commonly
required in consumer research and psychology publications.
}
\details{
Think of this as a comprehensive health check for your survey scale -
it tells you if your questions reliably measure what you think they measure.


## What These Measures Mean:

**Composite Reliability (CR)**:
- Like Cronbach's alpha but more accurate
- Uses factor loadings instead of correlations
- Threshold: CR ≥ 0.70 is good

**Average Variance Extracted (AVE)**:
- % of variance explained by the construct vs. measurement error
- Threshold: AVE ≥ 0.50 means construct explains majority of variance
- If AVE < 0.50, more variance is due to error than true scores

**Square Root of AVE**:
- Used to check discriminant validity
- Should be higher than correlations with other constructs

## Quality Thresholds (Fornell & Larcker, 1981):
- CR ≥ 0.70: Adequate reliability
- AVE ≥ 0.50: Adequate convergent validity
- √AVE > correlation with other constructs: Discriminant validity

## How This is Calculated:
1. Run a factor analysis to get item loadings
2. CR = (sum of loadings)² / [(sum of loadings)² + sum of error variances]
3. AVE = sum of squared loadings / number of items

# Example: Employee engagement scale
engagement_data <- data.frame(
  engaged_1 = c(7,8,6,9,7,8,9,7,6,8,7,9,8,7,8,9,7,8,7,8),

  engaged_3 = c(7,8,6,8,7,8,8,7,6,8,7,8,8,7,8,8,7,8,7,8),
  engaged_4 = c(8,8,7,9,8,9,9,8,7,9,8,9,9,8,9,9,8,9,8,9)
)

# Calculate comprehensive reliability
reliability <- calculate_composite_reliability(
  data = engagement_data,
  items = c("engaged_1", "engaged_2", "engaged_3", "engaged_4"),
  scale_name = "Employee Engagement"
