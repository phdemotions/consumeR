\usage{
check_homogeneity_of_variance(
  data,
  groups,
  alpha = 0.05,
  group_names = "groups"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector of values to test}

\item{groups}{Factor or vector indicating group membership. Will be coerced to factor.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for the test (default 0.05).
Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{group_names}{Character. Optional name for the grouping variable (for reporting).
Default is "groups". Used in all output messages.}

\description{
Tests whether groups have equal variances using Levene's test.
Required assumption for t-tests and ANOVA. Provides comprehensive
interpretation for beginners, including visual diagnostics, variance ratios,
and APA 7 formatted results.

This function is designed to be self-explanatory for users new to statistics,
with extensive validation and beginner-friendly error messages.

\details{
**What is homogeneity of variance?**

This assumption means that all groups being compared should have similar
amounts of variability (spread). For example, if comparing customer satisfaction
across 3 segments, each segment should have roughly the same standard deviation.

**How to interpret results:**
- If p > 0.05: Variances are equal (good news!)
- If p < 0.05: Variances differ (use Welch corrections)

**What to do if violated:**
1. Use Welch's t-test (for 2 groups) instead of Student's t-test
2. Use Welch's ANOVA (for 3+ groups) instead of standard ANOVA
3. Consider data transformation if variance ratio > 10

\examples{
# Example 1: Equal variances (assumption met)
set.seed(123)
data1 <- c(rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(50, mean = 12, sd = 2))
groups1 <- rep(c("Group A", "Group B"), each = 50)
check_homogeneity_of_variance(data1, groups1)

# Example 2: Unequal variances (assumption violated)
data2 <- c(rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 1), rnorm(50, mean = 12, sd = 5))
groups2 <- rep(c("Low Var", "High Var"), each = 50)
check_homogeneity_of_variance(data2, groups2)

# Example 3: With missing values
data3 <- c(rnorm(45, 10, 2), rep(NA, 5), rnorm(48, 12, 2), rep(NA, 2))
groups3 <- rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50)
check_homogeneity_of_variance(data3, groups3)
